<h1><h style="color:Blue">Websites Overview</h1>
<hr></hr>
Website is a location on web and is hosted on a web server. It is a set of related web pages. It is accessed using Internet address known as Uniform Resource Locator. 
When you browse the Internet you will come across quite often the word home page. Home page is the entry or starting point of a website. It is more or less in the format of the contents of a book or magazine. In other words it is the welcome page of the website you are visiting, which in most cases gives an overview of what the website contains. Website can have one or more than one page, or a few long ones, depending on its design. But normally the website contains more than one page.
Websites can be static or dynamic.

<h3><h style="color:red;">Static Websites</h3>
Static websitesÂ are also known as flat or stationary websites. They are loaded on the clientâ€™s browser as exactly they are stored on the web server. Such websites contain only static information. User can only read the information but canâ€™t do any modification or interact with the information. Static websites are created using only HTML. Static websites are only used when the information is no more required to be modified.

<h3><h style="color:red;">Dynamic Websites</h3>
Dynamic websitesÂ shows different information at different point of time. It is possible to change a portion of a web page without loading the entire web page. It has been made possible usingÂ AjaxÂ technology.

Server-side dynamic web page
It is created by using server-side scripting. There are server-side scripting parameters that determine how to assemble a new web page which also include setting up of more client-side processing.
Client-side dynamic web page
It is processed using client side scripting such as JavaScript.

<h1><h style="color:blue;">3.2	Website Designing
</h1>
Web designing has direct link to visual aspect of a web site. Effective web design is necessary to communicate ideas effectively. It involves a structured approach involving conceptualization of design and organizing the web developer and information resources required making the designing a reality. 
If the design is for a large and complex site, it is always advisable to note down all the planning, preferably in a notebook. This note book can be used as a guide to deliver all the raw material needed for web designing such as: HTML, Java scripts, graphics, text, animation and icons, etc. 

<h3><h style="color:Orange;">Wireframe</h3>
WireframeÂ refers to a visual guide to appearance of web pages. It helps to define structure of web site, linking between web pages and layout of visual elements.
Following things are included in a wireframe:
<li>Boxes of primary graphical elements</li>
<li>Placement of headlines and sub headings</li>
<li>Simple layout structure</li>
<li>Calls to action</li>
<li>Text blocks</li>
Wireframe can be created using program like Visio but you can also use a pen and paper.

<h4>Key Points</h4>
Design Plan should include the following:
<li>Details about information architecture.</li>
<li>Planned structure of site.</li>
<li>A site map of pages</li>

<h3><h style="color:purple">Web Page Anatomy</h3>
A web site includes the following components:
<li>Containing Block</li>
ContainerÂ can be in the form of pageâ€™s body tag, an all containing div tag. Without container there would be no place to put the contents of a web page.
<li>Logo</li>
LogoÂ refers to the identity of a website and is used across a companyâ€™s various forms of marketing such as business cards, letterhead, brochures and so on.
<li>Navigation</li>
The siteâ€™sÂ navigation systemÂ should be easy to find and use. Often the navigation is placed right at the top of the page.
<li>Content</li>
The content on a web site should be relevant to the purpose of the web site.
<li>Footer</li>
FooterÂ is located at the bottom of the page. It usually contains copyright, contract and legal information as well as few links to the main sections of the site.
<li>Whitespace</li>
It is also called asÂ negative spaceÂ and refers to any area of page that is not covered by type or illustrations.


Design Basics 
Following are some basic steps to be followed while creating web pages. 
Create a Welcome/Index/first page of your web site. 
Avoid use of heavy graphics in the first page from the userâ€˜s point of view. 
Page should be descriptive and interactive both as per requirements. 

 Some minimum technical requirements might include: 
<li>Fast loading of pages</li>
<li>Presentation with clarity and readability - with or without graphics </li>
Validation of the contents Easy and clear navigation Instruction on how to use the site. 

Important Elements in Web design
Layout a Web Page
The layout is the way the elements are positioned on the page, it is your foundation for images, text, navigation, etc.
Fonts and Typography
FontsÂ are the way your text looks on a web page. This is a vital element because most web pages include large amounts of text. When you're thinking of design, you need to think about how the text looks on a micro-level (the font glyphs, font family, etc.) as well as the macro-level (positioning blocks of text and adjusting the size and shape of the text).Â It's certainly not as simple as choosing a font and a few tips will help you get
Website's Color Scheme
Color is everywhere. It's how we dress up our world and how we see things. Color has meaning beyond just "red" or "blue" and color is an important design element.

<h3>Website Management</h3>
<hr></hr>
<div style="background:lightblue";>
<img src="Screenshot_2023-03-15-12-08-58-93.jpg"width="400"height="200">    
If you think about it, every website has a color scheme. It adds to the brand identity of the site and flows into each page as well as other marketing materials. Determining your color scheme is a vital step in any design and should be considered carefully.
Graphics and Images
<img src="IMG_20230331_185822.jpg"width="400"height="200">    
Graphics are the fun part of building web pages. As the saying goes "a picture is worth 1,000 words" and that's also true in web design. The internet is a very visual medium and eye-catching photos and graphics can really add to your user engagement.
Unlike text, search engines have a difficult time telling what an image is of unless you give them that information. For that reason, designers can useÂ IMG tag attributesÂ like theÂ ALT tagÂ to include those important details.
<p>Navigation
Navigation is how your visitors get around from one page to another. It provides movement and gives visitors the chance to find other elements of your site.
You need to make sure thatÂ the structure of your websiteÂ (the information architecture) makes sense. It also needs to be extremely easy to find and read so visitors don't have to relyÂ on the search function.Â 
The ultimate goal is that your navigation and inline links help visitors explore your site. The longer you can keep them, the more likely you'll get them to buy whatever you're selling.
</p>
<p>
Design Considerations
Follow a simple and consistent design. Complex designs can confuse people, so keep it simple. A consistent design will let your readers concentrate on content, without having to waste time figuring out how to maneuver your layout. At Cornell, the time and workstation "power" required to load a Web page are still important considerations when using some of the latest Web authoring tools, especially if your visitor is connecting to campus with a modem. </p>

Web Publishing 
<p>

The process includes building and uploading websites, updating the associated webpages, and posting content to these webpages online. Web publishing comprises of personal, business, and community websites in addition to e-books and blogs.</p>
<p>
The content meant for web publishing can include text, videos, digital images, artwork, and other forms of media. Web publishing is also known as online publishing.
A publisher requires three things to publish content on the Internet:
</p>
<h2><h style="color:red">Website development software</h2>
<h3><h style="color:blue">Internet connection</h3>
<p>
A web server to host the website
The website development software can be a professional web design application like Dreamweaver or a straightforward web-based content management system like WordPress. 
</p>
<p>

Publishers require an Internet connection to upload the content to the web server. Major sites may utilize a dedicated server to host them; however, many smaller websites usually reside on shared servers that host an array of websites.
</p>
<p>
Since web publishing does not demand physical materials like ink and paper, it costs practically nothing to publish the content. Thus, anyone fulfilling the above three requirements can become a web publisher. In addition, web publishing brings countless visitors as the published contents are accessed by global visitors.
